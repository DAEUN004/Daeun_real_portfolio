    "Developed an advanced image classification and segmentation system to differentiate between tumor and non-tumor images and precisely identify brain tumors from MRI scans.\n\n. This innovative solution accelerates tumor detection, significantly reducing diagnostic time and costs.\nBy streamlining the diagnostic process, it provides critical support during the 2024 South Korean doctors' strike, addressing the shortage of medical professionals and enhancing early cancer detection capabilities.\n\n Future work: To add more parts of the brain segmentations for better analysis and create 3D point cloud model.",
